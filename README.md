# Start
To commence the use of this application, run yarn to download the dependencies.

# Run app
To run the application simply run yarn dev.

# data-source
NB: In the data-source.ts file I have set synchronize to true, this is only for the purposes of this test, in real-life production scenarios this should default to false, and migrations should be used instead.
